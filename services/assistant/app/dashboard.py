Kept out of `main.py` deliberately: `main.py` imports psycopg and FastAPI, so
anything defined there can only be tested with a database driver installed.
These functions are the two places the dashboard was reporting things it did
not know, so they are exactly the parts that need tests that run everywhere.

Nothing here does I/O.
